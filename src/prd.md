## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Learning Rust is challenging due to its unique concepts (ownership, borrowing, lifetimes) that don't exist in other languages. Traditional tutorial formats often lack hands-on practice and immediate feedback.

**User Context**: Developers wanting to learn Rust, ranging from beginners to experienced programmers learning a new paradigm. They need structured lessons with practical coding exercises.

**Critical Path**: 
1. Choose skill level → 
2. Start with fundamentals → 
3. Practice with interactive exercises → 
4. Build understanding progressively → 
5. Apply knowledge in mini-projects

**Key Moments**: 
1. First successful Rust compilation and execution
2. Understanding ownership concept through interactive examples
3. Building a complete small project

  - Compile Rust to WASM in the browser
  - Use rust-playground API for server-side compilation
  - Local WASM runner for basic exercises
- **Alternative**: Server-side compilation API (if WASM proves limiting)

### Data Architecture
- **User Progress**: Browser-based persistence using useKV
- **Lesson Content**: Static JSON/Markdown files
- **Code Examples**: Embedded in lesson data structure

### Security Considerations
- **Code Execution**: Sandboxed compilation environment
- **Resource Limits**: Compilation timeouts and memory limits
- **Safe Examples**: Curated, safe code examples only

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Confidence-building, approachable yet technical, trustworthy
**Design Personality**: Clean, modern, developer-focused but not intimidating
**Visual Metaphors**: Building blocks, progression paths, tool crafting
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that doesn't distract from learning

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with accent
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (#1e40af) - conveys trust, stability, intelligence
**Secondary Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds, subtle blues for progression
**Accent Color**: Rust orange (#f97316) - playful nod to the language name, used for success states
**Color Psychology**: Blue builds confidence and focus, orange provides warmth and achievement
**Color Accessibility**: High contrast ratios, colorblind-friendly combinations

**Foreground/Background Pairings**:
- background (white/light gray) → foreground (dark gray/black) ✓ WCAG AA
- card (pure white) → card-foreground (dark gray) ✓ WCAG AA  
- primary (deep blue) → primary-foreground (white) ✓ WCAG AA
- secondary (light blue) → secondary-foreground (dark blue) ✓ WCAG AA
- accent (rust orange) → accent-foreground (white) ✓ WCAG AA
- muted (light gray) → muted-foreground (medium gray) ✓ WCAG AA

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Technical yet readable - monospace for code, clean sans-serif for content
**Google Fonts**: 
- Headings: Inter (clean, modern, excellent readability)
- Body: Inter (consistency with headings)
- Code: JetBrains Mono (designed for programming, excellent legibility)

**Typographic Hierarchy**:
- H1: 2.5rem, bold, tight leading for lesson titles
- H2: 2rem, semibold for section headers  
- H3: 1.5rem, medium for subsections
- Body: 1rem, regular, 1.6 line height for optimal reading
- Code: 0.875rem, JetBrains Mono for inline code
- Code blocks: 0.875rem, JetBrains Mono with syntax highlighting

**Legibility Check**: Both Inter and JetBrains Mono score excellently for legibility and are specifically designed for technical content.

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Left-to-right flow with lesson content → code editor → results
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load and improve focus
**Grid System**: 12-column grid with consistent gutters, responsive breakpoints
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first, with code editor adapting to smaller screens
**Content Density**: Balanced - not overwhelming but information-rich

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions convey progress and state changes
**Hierarchy of Movement**: 
- Primary: Compilation state changes (loading → success/error)
- Secondary: Lesson navigation transitions
- Tertiary: Hover states and micro-interactions
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional yet encouraging, avoiding distracting motion

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**:
- Cards for lesson content and code areas
- Buttons for primary actions (run code, next lesson)
- Badges for progress indicators and skill levels
- Alerts for compilation results and tips
- Tabs for switching between concepts/exercises
- Progress bars for lesson completion

**Component States**: Clear visual feedback for loading, success, error, and disabled states

## Reflection

**What makes this approach uniquely suited**: Combines Rust's technical nature with immediate, hands-on practice. The interactive compilation eliminates setup barriers while focusing on Rust's unique concepts that require practical experience to understand.

**Assumptions to challenge**: 
- That browser-based compilation can handle all necessary Rust features
- That a linear progression works for all learning styles
- That immediate feedback is always more valuable than reflection time

**What would make this solution truly exceptional**: 
- Intelligent error explanations that teach rather than just report
- Adaptive difficulty based on user performance
- Community features for sharing solutions and getting help
- Integration with real Rust tooling and ecosystem
- Gamification elements that make learning addictive without being distracting
